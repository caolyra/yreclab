 Includes Marc's new modules to provide one line per model 
 track files. To get this option, specify ITRVER=0 in the 
 CONTROL namelist (nml1).
 
 Affected modules: WRTHEAD, WRTOUT


        9/28/09  LLP

 In readcoeos06 line 51 initialize all 10 elements of array eos to 1D0 to 
 eliminated an initial divide by zero error.
 
 In eqrelv line 145 ensure that variable FACTOR is non-zero. If it is, 
 set it to 1D-15. The log of FACTOR is taken, and this step eliminates 
 the resulting log(zero) error.
 
 Affected module: EQRELV, READCOEOS06


        09/24/09  LLP
	
 Bug fix in setscv. Out of table errors at line 206 and 211. Code for ensuring 
 that we are in the table when differencing going out in the table is ok. That 
 for the transverse derivatives does not check. Corrections made.
 
 Minor comments fix in envint
 
 Affected module: SETSCV, ENVINT
 
 
 06/28/09

 Changed chkcal to use hard-wired partial derivatives in the calibration, 
 rather than attempting to obtain them from scratch.

 Affected module: CHKCAL

 Want to change current code so that if log(Teff) is higher than the allowd 
 max or log(g) is out of range the atmosphere mode changes to KTTAU = 0 (gray),
 from KTTAU = 4 (Allard). 
 
 An argument, LAlFail, was added to AlSurfP. If this argument is true, either 
 end the program, or change KTAU (KTAU=0, a gray atmosphere, is suggested.)
 
 Also modified MAIN toensure that KTTAU is preserved during calibration.

 Affected modules: AlSurfP, ENVINT, MASSLOSS and MAIN

 Subroutine ludcmp changed to eliminate the PAUSE statement which 
 hung the run. On line 36 change 'PAUSE' TO 'STOP'

 Affected module: LUDCMP
 


	LATE MARCH, 2009     MHP

Subroutines modified to compute the convective overturn timescale and
permit the saturation threshold for angular momentum loss to be scaled
by the convective overturn timescale.

Subroutines altered:
midmod.f - compute convective overturn timescale defined as
taucz=Hp/v, with v defined 1 pressure scale height above the bottom
(or where Hp=R for a fully convective star)
wind.f, cowind.f - if wmax > 1 define it relative to the overturn
timescale instead of as an absolute angular velocity.

***BUG FIX***
Added common block to getalex06.f which was causing odd output, and
simplified coding logic in getopac.f.



	MID MARCH, 2009     MHP

Modified rotation routines to permit mixing for models with solid body
rotation (LSOLID = T)

Routines modified:

getw.f (reverted to prior version excepting minor comment change)
midmod.f (enforced SB rotation at each intermediate timestep)
seculr.f (enforced SB spindown in wind and disabled angular momentum
redistribution otherwise; mixing still performed.)



	EARLY MARCH, 2009   MHP
	
Change name of program to MODEL1.0

ADD SUPPORT FOR 2006 ALEXANDER OPACITY TABLES
	
06TAB: interpolate Alexander 2006 tables in (X,Z) for all (rho,T)
GETALEX06: interpolate Alexander 2006 tables in (rho,T)

3-09 Modified routines to:
GETOPAC: changed fixed temperature ramp between molecular and atomic
opacities to user-supplied variable ramp
GETOPAC: added option to use 2006 Alexander tables
SETUPOPAC:added option to read in 2006 Alexander tables
PARMIN: added variables to namelist for 2006 Alexander opacities and
temperature ramp between molecular and atomic.Added logic so that
Alex06 sets Alex95 and Kur90 to false and Alex95 sets Kur90 to false.

3-09 Modified common block NEWOPAC to incorporate additional Alexander
2006 opacity options and remove obsolete variables.  Removed ZOPAL952,
ZALEX2; added LALEX06, TMOLMIN,TMOLMAX.
Subroutines affected:
alxtbl.f
getopac.f
ll4th.f
ll95tbl.f
parmin.f
rdlaol.f
rdzlaol.f
setkrz.f
setllo.f
setupopac.f
starin.f
sulaol.f
surfopac.f
wrtlst.f
yalo3d.f
ykoeff.f
ylloc.f

To be done: quality control ensuring that the opacity table ramps
involve legal combinations of opacities.  Testing of the behavior of
the interpolation at the table edges.

                     MODEL4A		LLP  7/10/2007

MODEL4a  -  Calculates second derivatives numerically by differencing 
            repeated calls to current EOS, Previous EQSTAT renamed 
	    EQSTAT2. Current EQSTAT invokes EQSTAT2 to optain 
	    derivatives by numerical differencing.
	    
            Numerical derivative differencing steps are table interval 
	    divided by 100.
	    Table intervals are approximately delta PL=.150, 
	    delta TL=.030
     
            Based on MODEL3z
           

LLP  7/10/2007

            Also includes a minor bug fix. After reading the input model, 
	    STARIN sets LNEW to true so that the envelope triangle is 
	    automatically recalulated.

                     MODEL3Z		LLP  6/16/2007
     
An upgrade to YREC including:

1.   Grant Newsham's updated neutrino code

2.   OPAL 2006 Equation of State (EOS)
  
3.   Potekhin Conductive Opacities
   
4.   Minor Bug Fixes and Code Improvements
   
The base code for this upgrade is what I called 
MODEL3A, exchanged with Marc on July 2, 2006

I shall discuss each of these upgrades in turn.

LLP  6/16/2007
    

1.   Grant Newsham's updated neutrino code

This is an update to YREC based on code received 
from Grant Newsham on May 8, 2007.

It provides significantly imporved physics. There 
are no changes to the PARMIN NAMELISTs.
       
This code adds modules neutrino.f and nulosses.f

It updates modules engeb.f and parmin.f.

It eliminates modules bremssca.f, bremshe.f, bremsox.f, 
brem.f, neut.f and neutrino3.f
     
parmin.f was merged with my version of parmin.f which 
includes updates for the OPAL 2001 Equation of State (EOS), 
the OPAL 2006 EOS and Potekhin Conductive opacities.
     
The value of JSON in Grant's modules was reset to the 
base value of 5000 as used in the code I have been 
exchanging with Marc.


2.   OPAL 2006 Equation of State (EOS)
  
This update adds support for the OPAL 2006 EOS.

Two parameters have been added to the parmin.f NAMELIST:
    
-  LOPALE06. If TRUE it specifies that the OPAL 2006 EOS is 
   to be used. The OPAL EOS's are mutually exclusive in the 
   following priority order. If LOPALE06 is TRUE then LOPALE 
   (OPAL 1995 EOS) and LOPAL01 (OPAL 2001 EOS) are set to 
   FALSE. Similarly, if LOPALE01 is TRUE, then LOPALE is set 
   to FALSE.
   
-  FOPALE06 is a 256 character variable giving the location 
   of the specific OPAL 2006 table to be used in the current 
   run. Each table is custom generated for a specific value 
   of Z. I am presuming that these tables are already 
   available at OSU, as I received them from there. I have 
   not included them, as they are massive.  If needed, of 
   course, I would be glad to send them.
    
The code is an updated version of the OPAL 2001 EOS code 
already in place. The new modules are: eqbould06.f,  
esac06.f, gmass06.f, oeqos06.f, quadeos06.f, radsub06.f,
readcoeos06.f, rhoofp06.f and t6rinteos06.f. The updated 
modules are: eqstat.f, parmin.f, readco.f, readcoeos01.f,
rhoofp01.f and wrtlst.f. No modules were eliminated.


3.   Potekhin Conductive Opacities
   
This update adds support for Potekhin Conductive Opacities.
   
Two parameters have been added to the parmin.f NAMELIST:

 -  LcondOpacP. If TRUE the Potekhin Conductive Opacity 
    code and tables are used. 
  
    NOTE: The Potekhin code needs to know the amount of 
    ionization of H and He. It obtains this information 
    either from the SCV EOS or from the Yale EOS. Marc 
    advises that SCV is preferred. We therefore recommend 
    that LSCV be set TRUE.
      
-  FcondOpacP. A 256 character variable giving the 
   location of the Potekhin table, "condall.d". Note 
   Noted that the license to use the Potekhin results 
   requires that the file have that name. A copy of 
   the file is included in this distribution.

The new modules are:  CondOpacP.f and CondOpacPInt.f.
The updated modules are: parmin.f and getopac.f.
  
Potekhin table "condall.d" is included.


4.   Minor Bug Fixes and Code Improvements
   
	  Program ended with a STOP 912, caused by a negataive argument
	  to SQRT. Trigger was a relaxation step in which the luminosity 
	  of the ourter shell (HL(M))was negative. The stepsize in 
	  CRRECT was halved and the calculation retried.

        Program failed with negative or improper gas pressures in EQSAHA
	  when using theoretical model atmospheres (KTTAU=0, 1 or 2). The 
	  starting point (X0) for the atmospheric integration was past 
	  the endpoint (XLIM). A check is now made, and if X0 > XLIM 
	  the calculation is redone with the starting density atmd0 
	  reduced by a factor of 10. The calculation is redone and the 
        check/reduction of atmd0 repeated until XLIM is greater than X0.

	  	   
        Fixed an argument error in STARIN and RSCALE. Under some 
        circumstances STARIN calls RSCALE which in turn calls FINDSH 
        with array LC as argument. RSCALE was calling FINDSH with an 
        element variable LC (not an array) as argument. STOP XXX's 
        were occurring as nearby argument variables were being 
        overwritten. STARIN and RSCALE were modified to properly 
        pass array LC to FINDSH.

	  EQRELV failed with STOP XXX's when input density was too far 
        from output density and excessive corrections to density were
        generated. Corrections to log10(density) were limited to +- 4 
        (i..e. density can change  no more than a factor of 10,000. 
        Later it was found that at least some (if not all) of these 
        problems were caused by the STARIN/RSCALE bug described above.
	  
        Updated so that all modules contain starting SAVE statements.

	  A check that BETA must be greater than 10**(-6) was removed. Then
	  above corrections are believed to make it unnecessary.
