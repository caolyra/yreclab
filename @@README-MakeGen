   MODEL and Makefile geterators                   LLP 03/18/2009
   
   This is a description of the generator of the MODEL program and 
   the Makefile generator. All of these scripts and files must 
   reside in the same directory as the MODEL source.
   
   MAKEMAKE - Makefile generator
   The Makefile generator named Makemake. It sets the name of the 
   executable, sets the compiler options, and uses the output of 
   the Linux 'ls' command to generate the list of files to be used 
   to compile the MODEL program.
   
   There are four filesinvolved: MakeBeg in which the name of the 
   executable is set; MakeEnd in which the compiler options are set; 
   MakeLS, a c program which generates the list of Fortran files to be 
   used to compiled; and Makemake, a script which generates the make 
   file, named "Makefile".
   
   MAKEMODEL - Generator of MODEL executable
   There are two scripts used to generate the MODEL program. The first,
   MakeModel, compiles and, if successful, generates the executable.
   The date and time-stamped output goes to file "ListMakeModel". 
   The second script, ClrListMakeModel, does as advertised, It clears,
   then initialzes and date/time-stamps the compiler output file, 
   "ListMakeModel."
